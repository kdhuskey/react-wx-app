# Weather Wise


# Info
Weather wise is a simple weather app that takes data from openweathermap api and using react with redux displays the returned data on bootstrap cards. Once you input your zipcode the user can then toggle between different nav links to find more relevant data, such as 7 day forecast, 12 hour or 48 hour forecast.
